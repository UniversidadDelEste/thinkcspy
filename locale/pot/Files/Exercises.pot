msgid "At the bottom of this page is a very long file called ``mystery.txt`` The lines of this file contain either the word UP or DOWN or a pair of numbers.  UP and DOWN are instructions for a turtle to lift up or put down its tail.  The pairs of numbers are some x,y coordinates. Write a program that reads the file ``mystery.txt`` and uses the turtle to draw the picture described by the commands and the set of points."
