msgid "A **pure function** does not produce side effects. It communicates with the calling program only through parameters (which it does not modify) and a return value. Here is the ``doubleStuff`` function from the previous section written as a pure function. To use the pure function version of ``double_stuff`` to modify ``things``, you would assign the return value back to ``things``."
