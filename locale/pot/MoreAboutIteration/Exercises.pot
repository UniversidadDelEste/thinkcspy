msgid "After you have scaled an image too much it looks blocky.  One way of reducing the blockiness of the image is to replace each pixel with the average values of the pixels around it.  This has the effect of smoothing out the changes in color.  Write a function that takes an image as a parameter and smooths the image.  Your function should return a new image that is the same as the old but smoothed."

msgid "When you scan in images using a scanner they may have lots of noise due to dust particles on the image itself or the scanner itself, or the images may even be damaged.  One way of eliminating this noise is to replace each pixel by the median value of the pixels surrounding it."
