msgid "Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called **iteration**.  Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier. We've already seen the ``for`` statement in a previous chapter.  This is a very common form of iteration in Python. In this chapter we are going to look at the ``while`` statement --- another way to have your program do iteration."
