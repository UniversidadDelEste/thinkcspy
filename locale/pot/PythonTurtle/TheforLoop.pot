msgid "When we drew the square, it was quite tedious.  We had to move then turn, move then turn, etc. etc. four times.  If we were drawing a hexagon, or an octogon, or a polygon with 42 sides, it would have been a nightmare to duplicate all that code."

msgid "A basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some code over and over again.  In computer science, we refer to this repetitive idea as **iteration**.  In this section, we will explore some mechanisms for basic iteration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/PythonTurtle/TheforLoop.rst:32
msgid "In Python, the **for** statement allows us to write programs that implement iteration.   As a simple example, let's say we have some friends, and we'd like to send them each an email inviting them to our party.  We don't quite know how to send email yet, so for the moment we'll just print a message for each friend."

#: ../../_sources/PythonTurtle/TheforLoop.rst:51
msgid "Line 2  is the **loop body**.  The loop body is always indented. The indentation determines exactly what statements are \"in the loop\".  The loop body is performed one time for each name in the list."

msgid "On each *iteration* or *pass* of the loop, first a check is done to see if there are still more items to be processed.  If there are none left (this is called the **terminating condition** of the loop), the loop has finished. Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/PythonTurtle/TheforLoop.rst:58
msgid "If there are items still to be processed, the loop variable is updated to refer to the next item in the list.  This means, in this case, that the loop body is executed here 7 times, and each time `name` will refer to a different friend."
