We will refer to our first turtle using the variable name alex, but remember that you can choose any name you wish as long as you follow the naming rules from the previous chapter."

msgid "The first line tells Python to load a **module** named ``turtle``.  That module brings us two new types that we can use: the ``Turtle`` type, and the ``Screen`` type.  The dot notation ``turtle.Turtle`` means *\"The Turtle type that is defined within the turtle module\"*.   (Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the module name, ``turtle``, with a lowercase `t`, is different from the type ``Turtle`` because of the uppercase `T`.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/PythonTurtle/OurFirstTurtleProgram.rst:52
msgid "We then create and open what the turtle module calls a screen (we would prefer to call it a window, or in the case of this web version of Python simply a canvas), which we assign to variable `wn`. Every window contains a **canvas**, which is the area inside the window on which we can draw."

msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/PythonTurtle/OurFirstTurtleProgram.rst:60
