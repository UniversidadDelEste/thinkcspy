msgid "A **module** is a file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs. There are many Python modules that come with Python as part of the **standard library**. We have already used one of these quite extensively, the ``turtle`` module.  Recall that once we import the module, we can use things that are defined inside."

You will also see that there is a `Language Reference <http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/index.html>`_ and a `Tutorial <http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/index.html>`_, as well as installation instructions, how-tos, and frequently asked questions.
