msgid "A **module** is a file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs. There are many Python modules that come with Python as part of the **standard library**. We have already used one of these quite extensively, the ``turtle`` module.  Recall that once we import the module, we can use things that are defined inside."

msgid "But what if no one had told us about turtle?  How would we know that it exists. How would we know what it can do for us? The answer is to ask for help and the best place to get help about the Python programming environment is to consult with the Python Documentation."

The site contains a listing of all the standard modules that are available with Python (see `Global Module Index <http://docs.python.org/py3k/py-modindex.html>`_). You will also see that there is a `Language Reference <http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/index.html>`_ and a `Tutorial <http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/index.html>`_, as well as installation instructions, how-tos, and frequently asked questions.  We encourage you to become familiar with this site and to use it often."

We mentioned in the first chapter that programming is normally done using some type of development environment and that the activecode used here was strictly to help us learn.  It is not the way we write production programs."

In fact, only turtle, math, and random have been ported at this point.  If you wish to explore any additional modules, you will need to also explore using a more robust development environment."
