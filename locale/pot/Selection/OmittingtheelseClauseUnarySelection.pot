msgid "Another form of the ``if`` statement is one in which the ``else`` clause is omitted entirely. This creates what is sometimes called **unary selection**. In this case, when the condition evaluates to ``True``, the statements are executed.  Otherwise the flow of execution continues to the statement after the body of the ``if``."
