msgid "One conditional can also be **nested** within another. For example, assume we have two integer variables, ``x`` and ``y``. The following pattern of selection shows how we might decide how they are related to each other."

msgid "The outer conditional contains two branches. The second branch (the else from the outer) contains another ``if`` statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two branches could contain conditional statements as well."

msgid "In some programming languages, matching the if and the else is a problem.  However, in Python this is not the case. The indentation pattern tells us exactly which else belongs to which if."
