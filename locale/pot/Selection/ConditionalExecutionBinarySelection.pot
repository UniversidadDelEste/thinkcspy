msgid "In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. **Selection statements**, sometimes also referred to as **conditional statements**, give us this ability. The simplest form of selection is the **if statement**. This is sometimes referred to as **binary selection** since there are two possible paths of execution."
