msgid "Because dictionaries are mutable, you need to be aware of aliasing (as we saw with lists).  Whenever two variables refer to the same dictionary object, changes to one affect the other. For example, ``opposites`` is a dictionary that contains pairs of opposites."

msgid "As you can see from the ``is`` operator, ``alias`` and ``opposites`` refer to the same object."
