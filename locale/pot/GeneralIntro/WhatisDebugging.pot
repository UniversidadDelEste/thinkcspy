msgid "Programming is a complex process.  Since it is done by human beings, errors may often occur. Programming errors are called **bugs** and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called **debugging**.  Some claim that in 1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one of the first computers at Harvard, and the term **bug** has remained in use since. For more about this historic event, see `first bug <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H96566k.jpg>`__."

msgid "Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: `syntax errors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error>`__, `runtime errors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error>`__, and `semantic errors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error>`__.  It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly."
