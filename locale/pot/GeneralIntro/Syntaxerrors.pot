msgid "Python can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct; otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message.  **Syntax** refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, in English, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with a period. this sentence contains a **syntax error**. So does this one"

msgid "For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant problem, which is why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without problems. Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message and quit.  You will not be able to complete the execution of your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. However, as you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and you will also be able to find your errors faster."

msgid "A syntax error is an error in the structure of the python code that can be detected before the program is executed.   Python cannot usually tell if you are trying to divide by 0 until it is executing your program (e.g., you might be asking the user for a value and then dividing by that value - you cannot know what value the user will enter before you run the program)."

msgid "This is a problem with the formal structure of the program.  Python knows where colons are required and can detect when one is missing simply by looking at the code without running it."
