msgid "If problem solving is a central part of computer science, then the solutions that you create through the problem solving process are also important.  In computer science, we refer to these solutions as **algorithms**.  An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration."

msgid "Our goal in computer science is to take a problem and develop an algorithm that can serve as a general solution.  Once we have such a solution, we can use our computer to automate the execution.  As noted above, programming is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in a notation (a program) that can be followed by a computer.  These programs are written in **programming languages**."
