msgid "The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until you run the program. These errors are also called **exceptions** because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened."

msgid "Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one."

msgid "Python cannot reliably tell if you are trying to divide by 0 until it is executing your program (e.g., you might be asking the user for a value and then dividing by that value - you cannot know what value the user will enter before you run the program)."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a problem with the formal structure of the program.  Python knows where colons are required and can detect when one is missing simply by looking at the code without running it."

msgid "This will produce the wrong answer, but Python will not consider it an error at all.  The programmer is the one who understands that the answer produced is wrong."
