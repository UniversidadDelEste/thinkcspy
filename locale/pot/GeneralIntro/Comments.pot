msgid "As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why. For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing.  These notes are called comments."

msgid "A **comment** in a computer program is text that is intended only for the human reader - it is completely ignored by the interpreter. In Python, the `#` token starts a comment.  The rest of the line is ignored. Here is a new version of *Hello, World!*."

Blank lines are also ignored by the interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your programs much easier for humans to parse.  Use them liberally!"
