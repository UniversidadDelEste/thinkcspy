msgid "Add a ``distanceFromPoint`` method that works similar to ``distanceFromOrigin`` except that it takes a ``Point`` as a parameter and computes the distance between that point and self."

msgid "Add a method ``reflect_x`` to Point which returns a new Point, one which is the reflection of the point about the x-axis.  For example, ``Point(3, 5).reflect_x()`` is (3, -5)"

msgid "The equation of a straight line is  \"y = ax + b\", (or perhaps \"y = mx + c\"). The coefficients a and b completely describe the line.  Write a method in the Point class so that if a point instance is given another point, it will compute the equation of the straight line joining the two points.  It must return the two coefficients as a tuple of two values.  For example,   ::"

msgid "Add a method called ``move`` that will take two parameters, call them ``dx`` and ``dy``.  The method will cause the point to move in the x and y direction the number of units given. (Hint: you will change the values of the state of the point)"
