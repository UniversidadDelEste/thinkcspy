msgid "That won't work. It causes the runtime error ``IndexError: string index out of range``. The reason is that there is no letter at index position 6 in ``\"Banana\"``. Since we started counting at zero, the six indexes are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, we have to subtract 1 from ``length``.  Give it a try in the example above."
