msgid "It is often helpful to examine a character and test whether it is upper- or lowercase, or whether it is a character or a digit. The ``string`` module provides several constants that are useful for these purposes. One of these, ``string.digits`` is equivalent to \"0123456789\".  It can be used to check if a character is a digit using the ``in`` operator."

msgid "The string ``string.ascii_lowercase`` contains all of the ascii letters that the system considers to be lowercase. Similarly, ``string.ascii_uppercase`` contains all of the uppercase letters. ``string.punctuation`` comprises all the characters considered to be punctuation. Try the following and see what you get."
