msgid "We previously saw that each turtle instance has its own attributes and a number of methods that can be applied to the instance.  For example, we wrote ``tess.right(90)`` when we wanted the turtle object ``tess`` to perform the ``right`` method to turn to the right 90 degrees.  The \"dot notation\" is the way we connect the name of an object to the name of a method it can perform."

msgid "In this example, ``upper`` is a method that can be invoked on any string object to create a new string in which all the characters are in uppercase.  ``lower`` works in a similar fashion changing all characters in the string to lowercase.  (The original string ``ss`` remains unchanged.  A new string ``tt`` is created.)"
