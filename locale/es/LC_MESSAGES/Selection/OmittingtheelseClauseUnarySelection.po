"Another form of the ``if`` statement is one in which the ``else`` clause "
"is omitted entirely. This creates what is sometimes called **unary "
"selection**. In this case, when the condition evaluates to ``True``, the "
"statements are executed.  Otherwise the flow of execution continues to "
"the statement after the body of the ``if``."
