"In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to "
"check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. "
"**Selection statements**, sometimes also referred to as **conditional "
"statements**, give us this ability. The simplest form of selection is the"
" **if statement**. This is sometimes referred to as **binary selection** "
"since there are two possible paths of execution."

"The boolean expression after the ``if`` statement is called the "
"**condition**. If it is true, then the indented statements get executed. "
"If not, then the statements indented under the `else` clause get "
"executed."

"As with the function definition from the last chapter and other compound "
"statements like ``for``, the ``if`` statement consists of a header line "
"and a body. The header line begins with the keyword ``if`` followed by a "
"*boolean expression* and ends with a colon (:)."

"Each of the statements inside the first block of statements is executed "
"in order if the boolean expression evaluates to ``True``. The entire "
"first block of statements is skipped if the boolean expression evaluates "
"to ``False``, and instead all the statements under the ``else`` clause "
"are executed."
