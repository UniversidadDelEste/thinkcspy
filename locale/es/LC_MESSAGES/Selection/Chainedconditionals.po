"``elif`` is an abbreviation of ``else if``. Again, exactly one branch "
"will be executed. There is no limit of the number of ``elif`` statements "

"checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch "
"executes, and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is "
"true, only the first true branch executes."
