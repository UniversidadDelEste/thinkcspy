"The Python type for storing true and false values is called ``bool``, "
"named after the British mathematician, George Boole. George Boole created"
" *Boolean Algebra*, which is the basis of all modern computer arithmetic."

"There are only two **boolean values**.  They are ``True`` and ``False``."
"  Capitalization is important, since ``true`` and ``false`` are not "
"boolean values (remember Python is case sensitive)."

"It is extremely important to realize that True and False are not strings."
"   They are not surrounded by quotes.  They are the only two values in "
"the data type ``bool``.  Take a close look at the types shown below."

"A **boolean expression** is an expression that evaluates to a boolean "
"value. The equality operator, ``==``, compares two values and produces a "
"boolean value related to whether the two values are equal to one another."

"In the first statement, the two operands are equal, so the expression "
"evaluates to ``True``.  In the second statement, 5 is not equal to 6, so "
"we get ``False``."

"Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python "
"symbols are different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to"
" use a single equal sign (``=``) instead of a double equal sign (``==``)."
" Remember that ``=`` is an assignment operator and ``==`` is a comparison"
" operator. Also, there is no such thing as ``=<`` or ``=>``."

"Note too that an equality test is symmetric, but assignment is not. For "
"example, if ``a == 7`` then ``7 == a``. But in Python, the statement ``a "
"= 7`` is legal and ``7 = a`` is not. (Can you explain why?)"
