"The `slice` operator ``[n:m]`` returns the part of the string from the "
"n'th character to the m'th character, including the first but excluding "
"the last. In other words,  start with the character at index n and go up "
"to but do not include the character at index m. This behavior may seem "
"counter-intuitive but if you recall the ``range`` function, it did not "
"include its end point either."

"If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the "
"beginning of the string. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to "
"the end of the string."
