"The ``while`` loop can also control the generation of the index values.  "
"Remember that the programmer is responsible for setting up the initial "
"condition, making sure that the condition is correct, and making sure "
"that something changes inside the body to guarantee that the condition "
"will eventually fail."

"The loop condition is ``position < len(fruit)``, so when ``position`` is "
"equal to the length of the string, the condition is false, and the body "
"of the loop is not executed. The last character accessed is the one with "
"the index ``len(fruit)-1``, which is the last character in the string."
