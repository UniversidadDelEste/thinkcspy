"All of the compound data types we have studied in detail so far --- "
"strings, lists, and tuples --- are sequential collections.  This means "
"that the items in the collection are ordered from left to right and they "
"use integers as indices to access the values they contain."

"**Dictionaries** are a different kind of collection. They are Python's "
"built-in **mapping type**. A map is an unordered, associative collection."
"  The association, or mapping, is from a **key**, which can be any "
"immutable type, to a **value**, which can be any Python data object."

"As an example, we will create a dictionary to translate English words "
"into Spanish. For this dictionary, the keys are strings and the values "
"will also be strings."

"One way to create a dictionary is to start with the empty dictionary and "
"add **key-value pairs**. The empty dictionary is denoted ``{}``"

"The first assignment creates an empty dictionary named ``eng2sp``.  The "
"other assignments add new key-value pairs to the dictionary.  The left "
"hand side gives the dictionary and the key being associated.  The right "
"hand side gives the value being associated with that key. We can print "
"the current value of the dictionary in the usual way. The key-value pairs"
" of the dictionary are separated by commas. Each pair contains a key and "
"a value separated by a colon."

msgid ""
"The order of the pairs may not be what you expected. Python uses complex "
"algorithms, designed for very fast access, to determine where the key-"
"value pairs are stored in a dictionary. For our purposes we can think of "
"this ordering as unpredictable."

"Another way to create a dictionary is to provide a list of key-value "
"pairs using the same syntax as the previous output."

"It doesn't matter what order we write the pairs. The values in a "
"dictionary are accessed with keys, not with indices, so there is no need "
