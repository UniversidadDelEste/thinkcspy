"The ``del`` statement removes a key-value pair from a dictionary. For "
"example, the following dictionary contains the names of various fruits "

"means that the dictionary can be modified by referencing an association "
"on the left hand side of the assignment statement.  In the previous "
"example, instead of deleting the entry for ``pears``, we could have set "
"the inventory to ``0``."
