"Most functions require arguments, values that control how the function "
"does its job. For example, if you want to find the absolute value of a "
"number, you have to indicate what the number is. Python has a built-in "
"function for computing the absolute value:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:29
msgid "In this example, the arguments to the ``abs`` function are 5 and -5."

"Some functions take more than one argument. For example the math module "
"contains a function called ``pow`` which takes two arguments, the base "
"and the exponent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:49
msgid ""
"Of course, we have already seen that raising a base to an exponent can be"
" done with the ** operator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:51
msgid "Another built-in function that takes more than one argument is ``max``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:60
msgid ""
"``max`` can be sent any number of arguments, separated by commas, and "
"will return the maximum value sent. The arguments can be either simple "
"values or expressions. In the last example, 503 is returned, since it is "
"larger than 33, 125, and 1.  Note that ``max`` also works on lists of "
"values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:65
msgid ""
"Furthermore, functions like ``range``, ``int``, ``abs`` all return values"
" that can be used to build more complex expressions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:68
msgid ""
"So an important difference between these functions and one like "
"``drawSquare`` is that ``drawSquare`` was not executed because we wanted "
"it to compute a value --- on the contrary, we wrote ``drawSquare`` "
"because we wanted it to execute a sequence of steps that caused the "
"turtle to draw a specific shape."

"Functions that return values are sometimes called **fruitful functions**."
" In many other languages, a chunk that doesn't return a value is called a"
" **procedure**, but we will stick here with the Python way of also "
"calling it a function, or if we want to stress it, a *non-fruitful* "
"function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:79
msgid ""
"Fruitful functions still allow the user to provide information "
"(arguments).  However there is now an additional piece of data that is "
"returned from the function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:85
msgid ""
"How do we write our own fruitful function?  Let's start by creating a "
"very simple mathematical function that we will call ``square``.  The "
"square function will take one number as a parameter and return the result"
" of squaring that number.  Here is the black-box diagram with the Python "
"code following."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:103
msgid ""
"The **return** statement is followed by an expression which is evaluated."
"  Its result is returned to the caller as the \"fruit\" of calling this "
"function. Because the return statement can contain any Python expression "
"we could have avoided creating the **temporary variable** ``y`` and "
"simply used ``return x*x``. Try modifying the square function above to "
"see that this works just the same. On the other hand, using **temporary "
"variables** like ``y`` in the program above makes debugging easier.  "
"These temporary variables are referred to as **local variables**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:118
msgid ""
"Notice something important here. The name of the variable we pass as an "
"argument --- ``toSquare`` --- has nothing to do with the name of the "
"formal parameter --- ``x``.  It is as if  ``x = toSquare`` is executed "
"when ``square`` is called. It doesn't matter what the value was named in "
"the caller. In ``square``, it's name is ``x``.  You can see this very "
"clearly in codelens, where the global variables and the local variables "
"for the square function are in separate boxes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:126
msgid ""
"As you step through the example in codelens notice that the **return** "
"statement not only causes the function to return a value, but it also "
"returns the flow of control back to the place in the program where the "
"function call was made."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:142
msgid ""
"Another important thing to notice as you step through this codelens "
"demonstration is the movement of the red and green arrows.  Codelens uses"
" these arrows to show you where it is currently executing. Recall that "
"the red arrow always points to the next line of code that will be "
"executed.  The light green arrow points to the line that was just "
"executed in the last step."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:147
msgid ""
"When you first start running this codelens demonstration you will notice "
"that there is only a red arrow and it points to line 1.  This is because "
"line 1 is the next line to be executed and since it is the first line, "
"there is no previously executed line of code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:151
msgid ""
"When you click on the forward button, notice that the red arrow moves to "
"line 5, skipping lines 2 and 3 of the function (and the light green arrow"
" has now appeared on line 1).  Why is this? The answer is that function "
"definition is not the same as function execution.  Lines 2 and 3 will not"
" be executed until the function is called on line 6.  Line 1 defines the "
"function and the name ``square`` is added to the global variables, but "
"that is all the ``def`` does at that point.  The body of the function "
"will be executed later.  Continue to click the forward button to see how "
"the flow of control moves from the call, back up to the body of the "
"function, and then finally back to line 7, after the function has "
"returned its value and the value has been assigned to ``squareResult``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:167
msgid ""
"Finally, there is one more aspect of function return values that should "
"be noted.  All Python functions return the value ``None`` unless there is"
" an explicit return statement with a value other than ``None.`` Consider "
"the following common mistake made by beginning Python programmers.  As "
"you step through this example, pay very close attention to the return "
"value in the local variables listing.  Then look at what is printed when "
"the function returns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Functions/Functionsthatreturnvalues.rst:185
msgid ""
"The problem with this function is that even though it prints the value of"
" the square, that value will not be returned to the place where the call "
"was done.  Since line 6 uses the return value as the right hand side of "
"an assignment statement, the evaluation of the function will be ``None``."
"  In this case, ``squareResult`` will refer to that value after the "
"assignment statement and therefore the result printed in line 7 is "
"incorrect.  Typically, functions will return values that can be printed "
"or processed in some other way by the caller."
