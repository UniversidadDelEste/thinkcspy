"We have all had to work with fractions when we were younger.  Or, perhaps"
" you do a lot of cooking and have to manage measurements for ingredients."
"  In any case, fractions are something that we are familiar with. In this"
" chapter we will develop a class to represent a fraction including some "
"of the most common methods that we would like fractions to be able to do."

"A fraction is most commonly thought of as two integers, one over the "
"other, with a line separating them.  The number on the top is called the "
"numerator and the number on the bottom is called the denominator.  "
"Sometimes people use a slash for the line and sometimes they use a "
"straight line.  The fact is that it really does not matter so long as you"
" know which is the numerator and which is the denominator."

"To design our class, we simply need to use the analysis above to realize "
"that the `state` of a fraction object can be completely described by "
"representing two integers.  We can begin by implementing the ``Fraction``"
" class and the ``__init__`` method which will allow the user to provide a"
" numerator and a denominator for the fraction being created."

"Note that the ``__str__`` method provides a \"typical\" looking fraction "
"using a slash between the numerator and denominator. The figure below "
"shows the state of ``myfraction``.  We have also added a few simple "
"accessor methods, ``getNum`` and ``getDen``, that can return the state "
"values for the fraction."
