"The program in the previous section works fine but is very limited in "
"that it only works with one value for ``total_secs``.  What if we wanted "
"to rewrite the program so that it was more general.  One thing we could "
"do is allow the user to enter any value they wish for the number of "
"seconds.  The program could then print the proper result for that "
"starting value."

"In order to do this, we need a way to get **input** from the user.  "
"Luckily, in Python there is a built-in function to accomplish this task."
"  As you might expect, it is called ``input``."

"The input function allows the user to provide a **prompt string**.  When "
"the function is evaluated, the prompt is shown. The user of the program "
"can enter the name and press `return`. When this happens the text that "
"has been entered is returned from the `input` function, and in this case "
"assigned to the variable `n`.  Make sure you run this example a number of"
" times and try some different names in the input box that appears."

"It is very important to note that the ``input`` function returns a string"
" value.  Even if you asked the user to enter their age, you would get "
"back a string like ``\"17\"``.  It would be your job, as the programmer, "
"to convert that string into an int or a float, using the ``int`` or "
"``float`` converter functions we saw earlier."

"To modify our previous program, we will add an input statement to allow "
"the user to enter the number of seconds.  Then we will convert that "
"string to an integer.  From there the process is the same as before.  To "
"complete the example, we will print some appropriate output."

"The variable ``str_seconds`` will refer to the string that is entered by "
"the user. As we said above, even though this string may be ``7684``, it "
"is still a string and not a number.  To convert it to an integer, we use "
"the ``int`` function. The result is referred to by ``total_secs``.  Now, "
"each time you run the program, you can enter a new value for the number "
"of seconds to be converted."
