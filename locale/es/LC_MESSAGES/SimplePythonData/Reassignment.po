"As we have mentioned previously, it is legal to make more than one "
"assignment to the same variable. A new assignment makes an existing "
"variable refer to a new value (and stop referring to the old value)."

" its value is 7.  The assignment statement changes the value (the object)"

"It is important to note that in mathematics, a statement of equality is "
"always true.  If ``a is equal to b`` now, then ``a will always equal to "
"b``. In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables refer to "
"the same object and therefore have the same value.  They appear to be "
"equal.  However, because of the possibility of reassignment, they don't "
"have to stay that way:"

"Line 4 changes the value of ``a`` but does not change the value of ``b``,"
" so they are no longer equal. We will have much more to say about "
"equality in a later chapter."

"In some programming languages, a different symbol is used for assignment,"
" such as ``<-`` or ``:=``.  The intent is that this will help to avoid "
"confusion.  Python chose to use the tokens ``=`` for assignment, and "
"``==`` for equality.  This is a popular choice also found in languages "
"like C, C++, Java, and C#."
