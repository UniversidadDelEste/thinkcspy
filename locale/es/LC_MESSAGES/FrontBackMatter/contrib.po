"To paraphrase the philosophy of the Free Software Foundation, this book "
"is free like free speech, but not necessarily free like free pizza. It "
"came about because of a collaboration that would not have been possible "
"without the GNU Free Documentation License. So we would like to thank the"
" Free Software Foundation for developing this license and, of course, "
"making it available to us."

"We would also like to thank the more than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful "
"readers who have sent us suggestions and corrections over the past few "
"years. In the spirit of free software, we decided to express our "
"gratitude in the form of a contributor list.  Unfortunately, this list is"
" not complete, but we are doing our best to keep it up to date. It was "
"also getting too large to include everyone who sends in a typo or two. "
"You have our gratitude, and you have the personal satisfaction of making "
"a book you found useful better for you and everyone else who uses it. New"
" additions to the list for the 2nd edition will be those who have made "
"on-going contributions."

"suggestions will add you to the next version of the contributor list "
"(unless you ask to be omitted). Thank you!"
