"There are many books available if you want to learn to program in Python."

"Programming is not a \"spectator sport\".  It is something you do, "
"something you participate in. It would make sense, then, that the book "
"you use to learn programming should allow you to be active. That is our "
"goal."

"This book is meant to provide you with an interactive experience as you "
"learn to program in Python.  You can read the text, watch videos, and "
"write and execute Python code.  In addition to simply executing code, "
"there is a unique feature called 'codelens' that allows you to control "
"the flow of execution in order to gain a better understanding of how the "
"program works.."

"We have tried to use these different presentation techniques where they "
"are most appropriate.  In other words, sometimes it might be best to read"
" a description of some aspect of Python.  On a different occasion, is "
"might be best to execute a small example program.  Often we give you many"
" different options for covering the material.  Our hope is that you will "
"find that your understanding will be enhanced because you are able to "
"experience it in more than just one way."

"This edition of the book is hosted as a web application on "
"interactivepython.org. The reason is that for teaching purposes we want "
"our students to be able to save their work in a browser in the lab and "
"get back to it when they are in their room or in a different lab. We also"
" wanted them to be able to turn in homework assignments so that we can "
"grade them."

"This interactive textbook is a triumph of open source.  Not only have we "
"stood on the shoulders of Jeffrey Elkner et. al. as the starting point "
"for the prose but the interactive features of this book also make use of "
"open source software.  We are indebted to Scott Graham (skulpt.org) for "
"his open source Python interpreter written in Javascript.  In addition we"
" are indebted to Philip Guo "
"(https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/) for the Online Python "
"Tutor which forms the basis for Codelens."

"We would also like to acknowledge the Sphinx project for their fine work "
"in creating a documentation system that allows us to focus on writing not"
" endless hours of Javascript and html coding.  In particular without the "
"extension architecture of Sphinx this book would not have made it off the"
" ground."
