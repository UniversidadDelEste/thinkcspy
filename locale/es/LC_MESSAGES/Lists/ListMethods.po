"The dot operator can also be used to access built-in methods of list "
"objects. ``append`` is a list method which adds the argument passed to it"
" to the end of the list. Continuing with this example, we show several "
"other list methods.  Many of them are easy to understand."

"There are two ways to use the ``pop`` method.  The first, with no "
"parameter, will remove and return the last item of the list.  If you "
"provide a parameter for the position, ``pop`` will remove and return the "
"item at that position.  Either way the list is changed."

"The following table provides a summary of the list methods shown above.  "
"The column labeled `result` gives an explanation as to what the return "
"value is as it relates to the new value of the list.  The word "
"**mutator** means that the list is changed by the method but nothing is "
"returned (actually ``None`` is returned).  A **hybrid** method is one "
"that not only changes the list but also returns a value as its result.  "
"Finally, if the result is simply a return, then the list is unchanged by "
"the method."
