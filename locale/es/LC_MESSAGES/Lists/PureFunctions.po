"A **pure function** does not produce side effects. It communicates with "
"the calling program only through parameters (which it does not modify) "
"and a return value. Here is the ``doubleStuff`` function from the "
"previous section written as a pure function. To use the pure function "
"version of ``double_stuff`` to modify ``things``, you would assign the "
"return value back to ``things``."
