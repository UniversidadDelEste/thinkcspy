"A nested list is a list that appears as an element in another list. In "
"this list, the element with index 3 is a nested list. If we "
"print(``nested[3]``), we get ``[10, 20]``. To extract an element from the"
" nested list, we can proceed in two steps.  First, extract the nested "
"list, then extract the item of interest.  It is also possible to combine "
"those steps using bracket operators that evaluate from left to right."
