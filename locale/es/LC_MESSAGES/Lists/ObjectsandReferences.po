"In one case, ``a`` and ``b`` refer to two different string objects that "
"have the same value. In the second case, they refer to the same object. "

"We already know that objects can be identified using their unique "
"identifier.  We can also test whether two names refer to the same object "
"using the *is* operator.  The *is* operator will return true if the two "
"references are to the same object.  In other words, the references are "
"the same.  Try our example from above."

"The answer is ``True``.  This tells us that both ``a`` and ``b`` refer to"
" the same object, and that it is the second of the two reference diagrams"
" that describes the relationship. Since strings are *immutable*, Python "
"optimizes resources by making two names that refer to the same string "
"value refer to the same object."

"There is one other important thing to notice about this reference "
"diagram.  The variable ``a`` is a reference to a **collection of "
"references**.  Those references actually refer to the integer values in "
"the list.  In other words, a list is a collection of references to "
"objects.  Interestingly, even though ``a`` and ``b`` are two different "
"lists (two different collections of references), the integer object "
"``81`` is shared by both.  Like strings, integers are also immutable so "
"Python optimizes and lets everyone share the same object."
