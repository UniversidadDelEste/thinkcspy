"The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as the syntax"
" for accessing the characters of a string.  We use the index operator ( "
"``[]`` -- not to be confused with an empty list). The expression inside "
"the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0.  "
"Any integer expression can be used as an index and as with strings, "
"negative index values will locate items from the right instead of from "
"the left."
