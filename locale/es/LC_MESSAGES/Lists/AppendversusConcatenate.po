"The ``append`` method adds a new item to the end of a list.  It is also "
"possible to add a new item to the end of a list by using the "
"concatenation operator.  However, you need to be careful."

"Consider the following example.  The original list has 3 integers.  We "
"want to add the word \"cat\" to the end of the list."

"Here we have used ``append`` which simply modifies the list.  In order to"
" use concatenation, we need to write an assignment statement that uses "
"the accumulator pattern::"

"Note that the word \"cat\" needs to be placed in a list since the "
"concatenation operator needs two lists to do its work."

"It is also important to realize that with append, the original list is "
"simply modified. On the other hand, with concatenation, an entirely new "
"list is created.  This can be seen in the following codelens example "
"where ``newlist`` refers to a list which is a copy of the original list, "
"``origlist``, with the new item \"cat\" added to the end.  ``origlist`` "
"still contains the three values it did before the concatenation.  This is"
" why the assignment operation is necessary as part of the accumulator "
"pattern."
