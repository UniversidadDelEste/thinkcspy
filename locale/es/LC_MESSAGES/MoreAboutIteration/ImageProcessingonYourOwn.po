"If you want to try some image processing on your own, outside of the "
"textbook you can do so using the cImage module.  You can download "
"``cImage.py`` from `The github page <https://github.com/bnmnetp/cImage>`_"
" .   If you put ``cImage.py`` in the same folder as your program you can "
"then do the following to be fully compatible with the code in this book."

"One important caveat about using ``cImage.py`` is that it will only work "
"with GIF files unless you also install the Python Image Library.  The "
"easiest version to install is called ``Pillow``.  If you have the ``pip``"
" command installed on your computer this is really easy to install, with "
"``pip install pillow`` otherwise you will need to follow the instructions"
" on the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/>`_ "
"page.  With Pillow installed you will be able to use almost any kind of "
"image that you download."
