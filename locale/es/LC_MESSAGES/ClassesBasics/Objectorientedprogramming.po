"Python is an **object-oriented programming language**.  That means it "
"provides features that support `object-oriented programming "

"Object-oriented programming has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasn't "
"until the mid 1980s that it became the main `programming paradigm "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm>`__ used in the "
"creation of new software. It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly"
" increasing size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier"
" to modify these large and complex systems over time."

"Up to now, some of the programs we have been writing use a `procedural "
"programming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming>`__ "
"paradigm. In procedural programming the focus is on writing functions or "
"*procedures* which operate on data. In object-oriented programming the "
"focus is on the creation of **objects** which contain both data and "
"functionality together. Usually, each object definition corresponds to "
"some object or concept in the real world and the functions that operate "
"on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact."
