"Our constructor so far can only create points at location ``(0,0)``.  To "
"create a point at position (7, 6) requires that we provide some "
"additional capability for the user to pass information to the "
"constructor.  Since constructors are simply specially named functions, we"
" can use parameters (as we've seen before) to provide the specific "
"information."

"We can make our class constructor more general by putting extra "
"parameters into the ``__init__`` method, as shown in this codelens "
"example."

"Now when we create new points, we supply the x and y coordinates as "
"parameters.  When the point is created, the values of ``initX`` and "
"``initY`` are assigned to the state of the object."
