#: ../../_sources/IntroRecursion/Glossary.rst:54
msgid ""
"A definition which defines something in terms of itself. To be useful it "
"must include *base cases* which are not recursive. In this way it differs"
" from a *circular definition*.  Recursive definitions often provide an "
"elegant way to express complex data structures."

msgid ""

"making it useful for swapping values."
