"**Natural languages** are the languages that people speak, such as "
"English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although "
"people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally."

"**Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for "
"specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use "
"is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships "
"among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent "
"the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly::"

"Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, "
"``3+3=6`` is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but "
"``3=+6$`` is not. H\\ :sub:`2`\\ O is a syntactically correct chemical "
"name, but :sub:`2`\\ Zz is not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.rst:37
msgid ""
"Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to **tokens** and structure."
" Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, "
"and chemical elements. One of the problems with ``3=+6$`` is that ``$`` "
"is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as we know). "
"Similarly, :sub:`2`\\ Zz is not legal because there is no element with "
"the abbreviation ``Zz``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.rst:44
msgid ""
"The second type of syntax rule pertains to the **structure** of a "
"statement--- that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement "
"``3=+6$`` is structurally illegal because you can't place a plus sign "
"immediately after an equal sign.  Similarly, molecular formulas have to "
"have subscripts after the element name, not before."

"When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, "
"you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in"
" a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called "
"**parsing**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.rst:54
msgid ""
"For example, when you hear the sentence, \"The other shoe fell\", you "
"understand that the other shoe is the subject and fell is the verb.  Once"
" you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it means, or the "
"**semantics** of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a shoe is and "
"what it means to fall, you will understand the general implication of "
"this sentence."

"Although formal and natural languages have many features in common --- "

msgid ""
"Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using "
"contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to "
"be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has "
"exactly one meaning, regardless of context."

msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.rst:72

"In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural "
"languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose."
"  Formal languages are less redundant and more concise."

msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.rst:77
msgid ""
"Formal languages mean exactly what they say.  On the other hand, natural "
"languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If someone says, \"The other "
"shoe fell\", there is probably no shoe and nothing falling."

"You'll need to find the original joke to understand the idiomatic meaning"

"People who grow up speaking a natural language---everyone---often have a "
"hard time adjusting to formal languages. In some ways, the difference "
"between formal and natural language is like the difference between poetry"

"Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the "

#: ../../_sources/GeneralIntro/FormalandNaturalLanguages.rst:100

"Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal "
"languages). First, remember that formal languages are much more dense "
"than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the "
"structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read "
"from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in"
" your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure.  "
"Finally, the details matter. Little things like spelling errors and bad "
"punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a"
" big difference in a formal language."
