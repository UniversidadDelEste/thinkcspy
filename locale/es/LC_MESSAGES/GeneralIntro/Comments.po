"As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to "
"read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a "
"piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why. For this reason, "
"it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural "
"language what the program is doing.  These notes are called comments."

"A **comment** in a computer program is text that is intended only for the"
" human reader - it is completely ignored by the interpreter. In Python, "
"the `#` token starts a comment.  The rest of the line is ignored. Here is"
" a new version of *Hello, World!*."

"Notice that when you run this program, it still only prints the phrase "
"Hello, World!  None of the comments appear. You'll also notice that we've"
" left a blank line in the program.  Blank lines are also ignored by the "
"interpreter, but comments and blank lines can make your programs much "
"easier for humans to parse.  Use them liberally!"
