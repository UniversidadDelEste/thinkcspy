"A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform"
" a computation. The computation might be something as complex as "
"rendering an html page in a web browser or encoding a video and streaming"
" it across the network.  It can also be a symbolic computation, such as "
"searching for and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) "
"compiling a program."

"Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every program "
"you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions "
"that look more or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as "
"the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller "
"subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with "
"sequences of these basic instructions."
