"The third type of error is the **semantic error**. If there is a semantic"
" error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the "
"computer will not generate any error messages.  However, your program "
"will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it "
"will do what you told it to do."

"The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted "
"to write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong.  "
"Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work"
" backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure "
"out what it is doing."
