"Just like we can have many different integers in a program, we can have "
"many turtles.  Each of them is an independent object and we call each one"
" an **instance** of the Turtle type (class).  Each instance has its own "
"attributes and methods --- so alex might draw with a thin black pen and "
"be at some position, while tess might be going in her own direction with "
"a fat pink pen.  So here is what happens when alex completes a square and"
" tess completes her triangle:"

"There are 360 degrees in a full circle.  If you add up all the turns that"
" a turtle makes, *no matter what steps occurred between the turns*, you "
"can easily figure out if they add up to some multiple of 360.  This "
"should convince you that alex is facing in exactly the same direction as "
"he was when he was first created. (Geometry conventions have 0 degrees "
"facing East and that is the case here too!)"

"We could have left out the last turn for alex, but that would not have "
"been as satisfying.  If you're asked to draw a closed shape like a square"
" or a rectangle, it is a good idea to complete all the turns and to leave"
" the turtle back where it started, facing the same direction as it "
"started in. This makes reasoning about the program and composing chunks "
"of code into bigger programs easier for us humans!"

"We did the same with tess: she drew her triangle and turned through a "
"full 360 degress.  Then we turned her around and moved her aside.  Even "
"the blank line 18 is a hint about how the programmer's *mental chunking* "
"is working: in big terms, tess' movements were chunked as \"draw the "
"triangle\"  (lines 12-17) and then \"move away from the origin\" (lines "
"19 and 20)."
