"Turtle methods can use negative angles or distances.  So "
"``tess.forward(-100)`` will move tess backwards, and ``tess.left(-30)`` "
"turns her to the right. Additionally, because there are 360 degrees in a "
"circle, turning 30 to the left will leave you facing in the same "
"direction as turning 330 to the right! (The on-screen animation will "
"differ, though --- you will be able to tell if tess is turning clockwise "
"or counter-clockwise!)"

"This suggests that we don't need both a left and a right turn method --- "
"we could be minimalists, and just have one method.  There is also a "
"*backward* method.  (If you are very nerdy, you might enjoy saying "
"``alex.backward(-100)`` to move alex forward!)"

"Part of *thinking like a scientist* is to understand more of the "
"structure and rich relationships in your field.  So revising a few basic "
"facts about geometry and number lines, like we've done here is a good "
"start if we're going to play with turtles."

"A turtle's pen can be picked up or put down.  This allows us to move a "
"turtle to a different place without drawing a line.   The methods are "
"``up`` and ``down``.  Note that the methods ``penup`` and ``pendown`` do "
"the same thing."

"Every turtle can have its own shape.  The ones available \"out of the "
"box\" are ``arrow``, ``blank``, ``circle``, ``classic``, ``square``, "
"``triangle``, ``turtle``."

"You can speed up or slow down the turtle's animation speed. (Animation "
"controls how quickly the turtle turns and moves forward).  Speed settings"
" can be set between 1 (slowest) to 10 (fastest).  But if you set the "
"speed to 0, it has a special meaning --- turn off animation and go as "
"fast as possible."

"A turtle can \"stamp\" its footprint onto the canvas, and this will "
"remain after the turtle has moved somewhere else.  Stamping works even "
"when the pen is up."

"The list of integers shown above is created by printing the "
"``range(5,60,2)`` result.  It is only done to show you the distances "
"being used to move the turtle forward.  The actual use appears as part of"
" the ``for`` loop."

"One more thing to be careful about.  All except one of the shapes you see"
" on the screen here are footprints created by ``stamp``.  But the program"
" still only has *one* turtle instance --- can you figure out which one is"
" the real tess?  (Hint: if you're not sure, write a new line of code "
"after the ``for`` loop to change tess' color, or to put her pen down and "
"draw a line, or to change her shape, etc.)"
