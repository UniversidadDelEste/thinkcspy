"As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which "
"statement is about to be executed.  We call this the **control flow**, or"
" the **flow of execution** of the program.  When humans execute programs,"
" they often use their finger to point to each statement in turn.  So you "
"could think of control flow as \"Python's moving finger\"."

"Control flow until now has been strictly top to bottom, one statement at "
"a time.  We call this type of control **sequential**.  Sequential flow of"
" control is always assumed to be the default behavior for a computer "
"program.  The ``for`` statement changes this."

"Flow of control is often easy to visualize and understand if we draw a "
"flowchart. This flowchart shows the exact steps and logic of how the "
"``for`` statement executes."

"A codelens demonstration is a good way to help you visualize exactly how "
"the flow of control works with the for loop.  Try stepping forward and "
"backward through the program by pressing the buttons.  You can see the "
"value of ``name`` change as the loop iterates through the list of "
"friends."
