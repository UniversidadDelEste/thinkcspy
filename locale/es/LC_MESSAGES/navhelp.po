"One of the most important things that you can do when you are learning a "
"programming language is to write programs.  Unfortunately, typical "
"textbooks allow you to read about programming but don't allow you to "
"practice.  We have created a unique tool called **ActiveCode** that "
"allows you to write, modify, and execute programs right in the text "
"itself (right from the web browser).  Although this is certainly not the "
"way real programs are written, it provides an excellent environment for "
"learning a programming language like Python since you can experiment with"
" the language as you are reading."

"Take a look at the ActiveCode interpreter in action.  If we take a simple"
" Python program and make it active, you will see that it can be executed "
"directly by pressing the *Run* button.   Try pressing the *Run* button "
"below."

"In addition to ActiveCode, you can also execute Python code with the "
"assistance of a unique visualization tool.  This tool, known as "
"**CodeLens**, allows you to control the step by step execution of a "
"program.  It also lets you see the values of all variables as they are "
"created and modified.  The following example shows CodeLens in action on "
"the same simple program as we saw above.  Remember that in ActiveCode, "
"the source code executes from beginning to end and you can see the final "
"result.  In Codelens you can see and control the step by step progress.  "
"Try clicking on the *Forward* button below."
