"Python provides a module ``random`` that helps with tasks like this.  You"
" can take a look at it in the documentation.  Here are the key things we "
"can do with it."

"The ``randrange`` function generates an integer between its lower and "
"upper argument, using the same semantics as ``range`` --- so the lower "
"bound is included, but the upper bound is excluded.   All the values have"
" an equal probability of occurring (i.e. the results are *uniformly* "
"distributed)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/PythonModules/Therandommodule.rst:46
msgid ""
"The ``random()`` function returns a floating point number in the range "
"[0.0, 1.0) --- the square bracket means \"closed interval on the left\" "
"and the round parenthesis means \"open interval on the right\".  In other"
" words, 0.0 is possible, but all returned numbers will be strictly less "
"than 1.0.  It is usual to *scale* the results after calling this method, "
"to get them into a range suitable for your application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/PythonModules/Therandommodule.rst:52
msgid ""
"In the case shown here, we've converted the result of the method call to "
"a number in the range [0.0, 5.0).  Once more, these are uniformly "
"distributed numbers --- numbers close to 0 are just as likely to occur as"
" numbers close to 0.5, or numbers close to 1.0. If you continue to press "
"the run button you will see random values between 0.0 and up to but not "
"including 5.0."

"It is important to note that random number generators are based on a "
"**deterministic** algorithm --- repeatable and predictable. So they're "
"called **pseudo-random** generators --- they are not genuinely random. "
"They start with a *seed* value. Each time you ask for another random "
"number, you'll get one based on the current seed attribute, and the state"
" of the seed (which is one of the attributes of the generator) will be "
"updated.  The good news is that each time you run your program, the seed "
"value is likely to be different meaning that even though the random "
"numbers are being created algorithmically, you will likely get random "
"behavior each time you execute."
