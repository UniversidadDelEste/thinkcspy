"The ``math`` module contains the kinds of mathematical functions you "
"would typically find on your calculator and some mathematical constants "
"like `pi` and `e`. As we noted above, when we ``import math``, we create "
"a reference to a module object that contains these elements."

"Here are some items from the math module in action.  If you want more "
"information, you can check out the `Math Module "
"<http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/math.html#module-math>`_ Python "
"Documentation."

"Notice another difference between this module and our use of ``turtle``. "
"In  ``turtle`` we create objects (either ``Turtle`` or ``Screen``) and "
"call methods on those objects.  Remember that a turtle is a data object "
"(recall ``alex`` and ``tess``).  We need to create one in order to use "
"it.  When we say ``alex = turtle.Turtle()``, we are calling the "
"constructor for the Turtle class which returns a single turtle object."

"Mathematical functions do not need to be constructed.  They simply "
"perform a task. They are all housed together in a module called `math`.  "
"Once we have imported the math module, anything defined there can be used"
" in our program.  Notice that we always use the name of the module "
"followed by a `dot` followed by the specific item from the module "
"(``math.sqrt``).  You can think of this as lastname.firstname where the "
"lastname is the module family and the firstname is the individual entry "
"in the module."
